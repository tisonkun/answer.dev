Why hasn\'t my badge appeared yet?\\n\\n The vaunt data pulls took place before the two issues were created. This results in at most a 24-hour delay in when the achievement will be awarded. Achievements would have shown up automatically in the next data pull without any intervention, but Vaunt went ahead and re-ran the data pull operations on our end to trigger the achievement grants.\\n\\n3. Can I still get a badge if my issues aren\'t accepted?\\n\\n It\u2019s hard to say this, but it\u2019s a No.\\n We appreciate your participation greatly. For various reasons, your suggested enhancement might not align with our roadmap or product direction as you may think. We recommend you start with a bug. A bug is a bug, and this will increase your chances of earning a badge."},{"id":"/2023/09/14/build-your-online-community-like-the-pros-with-answer","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2023/09/14/build-your-online-community-like-the-pros-with-answer","editUrl":"https://crowdin.com/project/answer-website/zh-CN","source":"@site/i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-09-14-build-your-online-community-like-the-pros-with-answer/index.md","title":"Build Your Online Community Like the Pros with Answer","description":"From inception to execution, make your online community happen in 4 steps with Answer.","date":"2023-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2023\u5e749\u670814\u65e5","tags":[],"readingTime":4.82,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Zhu","title":"Product Marketing Manager","url":"https://github.com/PrimmaAnna","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131739771?v=4","key":"Anne"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Build Your Online Community Like the Pros with Answer","authors":["Anne"],"category":"Best Practice","featured":true,"image":"2023-09-14-cover@4x.png","description":"From inception to execution, make your online community happen in 4 steps with Answer."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Celebrate Answer\u2019s First Anniversary with Hacktoberfest 2023","permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2023/09/27/celebrate-answer-first-anniversary-with-hacktoberfest-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Manage Content System Efficiently with Answer","permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2023/08/09/how-to-manage-content-system-efficiently-with-answer"}},"content":"Q&A is one of the most effective ways to obtain knowledge, build connections, and create interaction.

Why is Answer\'s plugin system designed in such a way that it seems a bit difficult to use?\\n> 2. How can I implement plugin functionality using Golang?\\n> 3. What exactly does Answer\'s plugin system do when it is compiled and packaged?\\n\\n## Background\\nYou can build a Q&A community using Answer easily. However, the basic features of Answer may not sufficiently support to every use case.\\nTherefore, we need to design a plugin system to extend its features.\\nAs you may know, Answer is built using `React.js` and `Golang`. Both these languages require compilation. So designing a plugin system is a bit difficult.\\n\\n## Goal & Features\\nThe goal of Answer\'s plugin system is to provide a **flexible** and **extendable** architecture that can accommodate a wide range of use cases. Some of the key features of the plugin system include:\\n\\n### Connectors\\nBy default, Answer supports login via email and password. Within the plugin system, developers can easily integrate other authentication, such as GitHub.\\n\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-connector.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n### Storage\\nOut of the box, Answer stores files in the local file system. However, there could be scenarios where users might prefer to save their uploaded files to a cloud storage service like `S3`. This can be achieved by the plugin system.\\n\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-storage.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n## Implementation\\nNow, let\'s explore how the plugin system is implemented, followed by the reasons behind our design decisions.\\n\\n### Details\\nThe general process is as follows:\\n<img src={require(\'./answer-plugin-build-brief.png\').default} alt=\\"install-choose-language\\" width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in implementing a plugin:\\n\\n1. Generate a `main.go` file.\\n2. Import the specific plugin list.\\n3. Execute `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` to manage dependencies.\\n4. Copy the UI directory.\\n5. Overwrite the `index.ts` file.\\n6. Execute `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to manage the package and build the project.\\n7. Merge the `i18n` file from the plugin with the original `i18n` file.\\n8. Build a new binary.\\n9. Clean up the byproducts generated during the build process.\\n\\n![answer-plugin-build-all.png](answer-plugin-build-all.png)\\n\\n### Reason\\nHere are the reasons behind our design choices:\\n\\n#### Static Compilation\\n> This is the main reason why the plugin system is designed this way.\\n\\n`React.js` and `Golang` both these languages require compilation. They are not dynamically executable like some other scripting languages.\\nSo the plugin system should be a static compilation, which means that the application and plugins are compiled together, resulting in a single binary that can be easily distributed and deployed.\\n\\n#### Fixed Functionality\\nThe plugin system allows users to add features that are fixed for their specific use cases without changing the core system.\\nFurthermore, these functionalities persistently remain operational once they are employed. \\nTherefore, it is sufficient to deliberate on the necessities of their incorporation at the initial stage, and subsequently, package them accordingly.\\nIn the future, we can build a Docker image that contains all official plugins, thereby enabling users to access the entire range of features. The enablement or disablement of these functionalities can be managed through the plugin control interface.\\n\\n#### Extension\\nThe most important capability of a plugin system is its extensibility.\\nA program can\'t provide all the functions that every user wants. \\nHowever, with a plugin system, users can develop their plugins to help them achieve the functions that they want.\\n\\n## Reference\\nThe Caddy is a great open-source software that inspired the design of the Answer plugin system.\\nCaddy is a web server that allows developers to extend its functionality using plugins. \\nUsing [xcaddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/) can easy to make custom builds of the Caddy Web Server. \\n \\n## More\\nIn this blog post, we discussed the design and implementation of the plugin system for Answer, a popular open-source Q&A platform. \\nWe discussed the motivation behind the design, and the features and principles of the plugin system, and provided a step-by-step guide on implementation. \\nIf you are interested in developing plugins for Answer, please feel free to leave us a comment. \\nWe will also write an article on how to implement an Answer plugin from scratch, so stay focused!"},{"id":"/2023/07/19/how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh-CN/blog/2023/07/19/how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community","editUrl":"https://crowdin.com/project/answer-website/zh-CN","source":"@site/i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2023-07-19-how-to-utilize-reputation-and-privilege-in-online-community/index.md","title":"How to Utilize Reputation and Privilege in Online Community","description":"Meet Answer\u2019s reputation and privilege systems and automate them for efficient community content management.

Community members gain reputation scores by adhering to community guidelines and continuous contributions. Community moderators and administrators use reputation scores to determine user privileges. This helps run and maintain a healthy community environment and discourages disruptive behavior.\\n\\n## Purposes of Reputation\\n\\nIn the mid-1900s, eBay introduced a feedback system, allowing buyers and sellers to rate each other based on transaction experience.

Trust Building\\n\\nA positive reputation indicates credibility, reliability, and expertise. In Answer, you can always find a reputation score next to the name, providing an initial impression of the community member.\\n\\n![Reputation Score Next to Community Member in Answer](TrustBuilding1.png)\\n\\nClick the name and jump to a community member\u2019s profile page, where it includes reputation and related contributions.\\n\\n![Community Member Profile in Answer](TrustBuilding2.png)\\n\\n### 2.

Moderation and Governance\\n\\nAfter activation in Answer, community members will gain 1 reputation score, and are allowed to participate in general activities in the community, such as asking questions, writing answers, upvote comment, etc. Reputation scores are also used by community moderators and administrators to determine user [privileges](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/permission), such as posting more than 2 links at a time, creating a new tag, etc.\\n\\n![Add a New Tag in Answer](AddaNewTag.png)\\n\\nIn Answer, you\u2019ll need 125 reputation scores to downvote, while downvote someone\u2019s answer will reduce one reputation score. This prevents malicious downvoting and boosts answers through intentional others\u2019 answers. This helps maintain a healthy community environment and discourage disruptive behavior.\\n\\nThe scale of communities is different, so is the reputation system. We\u2019ve prepared 3 different privilege levels for teams at different scales.\\n\\n![Levels of Privileges in Answer](LevelsofPrivileges.png)\\n\\n### 4. Community Engagement\\n\\nThe reputation system allows community members to actively engage in the community. They can share expertise, contribute to discussions, and vote for better answers, fostering a positive and collaborative environment.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nReputation in an online community is a reflection of a user\u2019s contributions, engagement, and commitment to the community.

That\u2019s what help center comes for: provide the right information, in a right approach, at the right time for your customers.\\n\\nIn today\u2019s blog, we will build a help center from the scratch with a bit of community sprit in Answer.\\n\\n## What\u2019s a Help Center\\n\\nA Help Center serves as a valuable resource for users. It provides customers immediate help by helping them find answers and resolve issues independently.\\n\\nWhen building a help center, here are 2 common questions you need to address:  \\n\\n**What types of answers or help do users require?**\\n**How can they always get the answers they require?**\\n**How can I maintain and run help center efficiently?**\\n\\nNo worries, we will resolve these problems one by one and build a help center from the scratch together in the coming part of this blog.\\n\\n## Why Answer for a Help Center?\\n\\nHere\u2019s how a traditional help center works: users come and seek answers, administrators provide answers constantly, and everything goes over again.\\n\\n![Traditional Help Center](HowHelpCenterWorks.png)\\n\\nAs the content in the help center becomes abundant, things change. For users, finding the correct answer can be challenging. Similarly, administrators face the pressure of maintaining, and running an effective help center.\\n\\nHowever, in Answer, everything is entirely different from traditional help center.\\nIn Answer, **everyone can ask and respond**, creating a mutual way interaction. Every user can ask a question, contribute, vote for an answer, etc. Here, the user is no longer waiting for answers passively, but becomes a part of help center management. This also alleviates the pressure of administrators, allowing them to focus on the roadmap of the help center.\\n\\n## Build a Help Center with Answer (Tutorials and Tips)\\n\\nThe essence of a help center is to provide the right answer to the problems occurring already, and Answer is born for this.

Though users are actively becoming a part of the community, moderators still need regular review and edit. Keep an eye on product launch, tweaks and updates, and you\u2019ll notice how effective tags can be when updating the content.\\n\\nWhen updating or editing a post, use [Unlist](https://answer.apache.org/blog/2023/05/11/answer-1.0.9-release#whats-new) to hide the post temporarily to avoid misunderstanding.\\n\\n![Unlist a Question in Answer](UnlistQuestion.gif)\\n\\n### 05.

Effective knowledge sharing increases productivity, and enhances collaboration within your team.\\n\\nAnswer was inspired by the inherent openness of Q&A platforms and communities. As the team behind Answer, we appreciate and embody the spirit of knowledge sharing when tuning Answer.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will explore types of knowledge, ways of knowledge sharing, and strategies to improve knowledge sharing for your team with Answer.\\n\\n## What is Knowledge Sharing?\\n\\n[![Knowledge Sharing](knowledgesharing1.jpeg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/140596819595429978/)\\n\\n[Knowledge Sharing\xa0Comic by Dilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_sharing)is an activity through which knowledge (namely, information, skills, or expertise) is exchanged among people, friends, peers, families, communities, or within or between organizations.\\n\\nAnswer is a platform for knowledge sharing, and the form of asking and answering is a natural way of knowledge sharing. The information in Answer can be documented for every user to check. Admins can modify them for keeping them up-to-date.\\n\\n## 3 Types and Ways of Knowledge Sharing\\n\\n01. Explicit Knowledge\\n Also known as expressive knowledge. It is the knowledge that can be formalized, easily articulated, and can be written down or shared in documents and manuals. Explicit knowledge includes: user manuals, case studies, SOPs, etc.\\n Explicit knowledge is absolute and ready for sharing so that you can share it with confidence.\\n   ![Explicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing2.png)\\n\\n02. Implicit Knowledge\\n The knowledge is developed through years of practice, observation, and experience. It is commonly associated with skills, expertise, and \\"know-how\\" in various domains, such as craftsmanship, sports, arts, or professional practices.\\n Implicit knowledge sharing is diverse, since everyone has different approaches to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.\\n    ![Implicit Knowledge](knowledgesharing3.png)\\n\\n03. Tacit Knowledge\\n Tacit knowledge is gained through experience and practice, which makes it hard to articulate or transfer explicitly. It is personal, subjective, and hard to put into words.\\n Tacit knowledge sharing is through direct interactions, observation, and mentorship.\\n   ![Tacit Knowledge](knowledgesharing4.png)\\n\\n## Effective Knowledge Sharing with Answer\\n\\nNo matter which type of knowledge your company or team has, it never goes wrong to capture, store and share them effectively for everyone on the team.\\n\\nEffective knowledge sharing involves sharing information, expertise, and insights. It requires creating a culture that values collaboration and providing tools for easy exchange of knowledge. Here\u2019s how Answer helps for effective knowledge sharing.\\n\\n1. Open and Collaborative Culture\\n Encourage and value knowledge sharing for everyone on the team. The essence of Answer is open source, and the Q&A platform itself is open and collaborative.\\n In Answer, you can customize the layout and add rules in the sidebar to remind everyone subtly.\\n ![Customize Right Sidebar](knowledgesharing5.png)\\n You can also pin the welcome post that includes regulations, values, and spirit of your platform, ensuring new members can see the post as soon as they join your community, while helping community members to check.\\n ![Alt text](knowledgesharing6.png)\\n  \\n2. Make Knowledge Accessible\\n In Answer, sharing and accessing to knowledge is like breathing. Everyone is a loop of knowledge sharing: add a question, provide answer, upvote, etc. This fosters a collaborative spirit for the community naturally.\\n ![Answer a Question](knowledgesharing7.png)\\n\\n Admin can also add wikis, FAQ for users in the sidebar to provide relevant knowledge.\\n ![Customize Left Sidebar](knowledgesharing8.png)\\n\\n3. Effective Knowledge Management  \\n Besides knowledge storage, and creation, knowledge management is the key that keeps your platform running. In Answer, you can manage different types of knowledge by tags. You can find tags are like troops, guarding each question so that you can identify the category you need immediately.\\n ![Tags with Post](knowledgesharing9.png)\\n Managing tags is also easy. Admins can add, edit or remove a tag in one place.\\n ![Manage Tags](knowledgesharing10.png)\\n4. Recognition and Rewards\\n Express gratitude to the contributors and experts.\\n In Answer, we\u2019ve automated the [reputation system](https://answer.apache.org/docs/recipes/contents/reputation), encouraging ownership and motivation to share valuable insights. Users can earn reputation scores by asking questions that everyone concerns, receiving votes from other users, answers accepted. It\u2019s a reflection of how active you are in the community. With more reputation scores, you\u2019ll unlock more features, such as upvote, invite an answer, edit other\u2019s question, etc.\\n\\n5. Feedback and Evaluation  \\n Encouraging feedback loops and continuous improvement for your community. Once you\'ve obtained a sufficient reputation score, you can start voting for questions or answers, providing feedback to enhance its quality and relevance.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUnderstand three types of knowledge and find an effective way to share in the team.
